## Project Description
This project involves car price prediction using a Linear Regression model. The model is trained on the Quickr Car dataset, which contains features of various cars and their corresponding prices. The goal is to predict the price of a car based on its features.

The trained model can predict the price of a car given its attributes.

### Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data
- The dataset used for this project is the Quickr Car dataset, containing information about various cars and their prices.
- Download the Quickr Car cleaned dataset and place it in the directory.

### Model Training
- Load and preprocess the Quickr Car dataset.
- Implement a Linear Regression model and train it on the preprocessed data.

### Usage
- Load the trained Linear Regression model.
- Use the model to predict the price of a car based on its features.

### Flask Web App
- Create a Flask web application to allow users to input car features and receive price predictions.
- Implement routes and templates to display the predicted car price.
